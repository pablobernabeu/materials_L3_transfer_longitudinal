# Materials for 'Starting from the very beginning: Unraveling third language (L3) development with longitudinal data from artificial language learning and related epistemology'

## Content 

The present repository contains the materials presented in [González Alonso
et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14790718.2024.2415993). These materials 
are more findable, accessible, interoperable, reproducible and reusable than 
the materials of most related studies (see [poster](https://osf.io/h83yq)).

## Complete materials

The present GitHub repository mainly serves to facilitate the consultation 
of individual files. However, due to GitHub's limit of 100 MB per file, one 
larger file is missing, namely, 
`stimulus_preparation/external_corpora/nowac-1.1.lemma.frek.sort_alf_frek.txt`. 
This file and all others are available in a zipped R project that can be 
downloaded from https://osf.io/download/wbjyr. 

## Documentation

This readme file contains the most general notes. Further readme files 
exist in subsequent folders. For instance, the experimenters 
facilitating the lab sessions are advised to read the readme file in 
the session_materials folder.

## Session materials

The stimuli are prepared in the 'stimulus_preparation' folder, and 
stored in the 'session_materials' folder, along with the OpenSesame 
file for each session.
